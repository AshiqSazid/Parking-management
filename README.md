# Parking-Management-System
CSE470 Project

My project focuses on developing a "Parking Management System" website. The core functionalities are organized within the "application" folder, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Within this structure, I've separated the model, class, and views for better organization and maintainability. Additionally, I've implemented unit testing using PHPUnit, which resides in the "test" folder. This ensures that the code functions as expected and helps identify any potential issues early in the development process.
